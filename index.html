				Class seems pretty straightforward. But, there's <strong>a lot going on under the surface</strong> that affects us directly. It might make you think very differently from your initial answer.
			</p>
			<p>For instance, the <strong>kind of job you have</strong> is probably the first thing you thought of.</p>
			<p>And yes, it has a massive effect on your financial status. But it’s more than jobs that pay a little, and jobs that pay a lot.</p>
			<p>It’s also about <strong>how much your job guarantees you’ll earn enough</strong> to make a living.</p>

				<p>In the case of part time jobs, contract work, and self-employment, <strong>the amount of work you can complete varies wildly</strong>. And putting extra effort into getting enough hours of work in each week means extra stress.</p>
				<p>This is <strong>underemployment</strong>, it's a big issue that isn't talked about. The number of people who are underemployed is <strong>almost as large</strong> as those who are unemployed.

					<strong>Class isn't just a job-by-job thing either</strong>. Those of parents with high-prestige jobs will usually earn more, even for the exact same job.

				<p>So class is more than job distinctions or salary. But this is <strong>just the tip of the iceberg.</strong></p>
		<p>Naturally, wealth determines what housing you can buy, and in turn where

				<p>A wide variety of resources available to you depend on the wealth of your suburb &mdash; from food, medical care and banking, to libraries and public pools.</p>

				<p>And if you’re stuck without a car, that extra amount of distance is a big deal. Travelling on public transport with large amounts of groceries isn’t an option.</p>

				<p>So how do we decide what our class is when considering so many aspects of our lives?</p>
				<p>The categories are completely made up, so it’s up to us to decide what best fits the Australian circumstance. But there’s always going to be trade offs.</p>
				<p>Jill Sheppard and Nick Biddle came up with six classes. Each of these categories are distinct in each way we’ve talked about today - career, wealth, where they live, who they’re mates with, and what entertainment they like.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>The Precariat</dt><dd>The group doing it toughest.</dd>
					<dt>Ageing Workers</dt><dd>A traditional working class, the majority of which are pensioners.</dd>
					<dt>New Workers</dt><dd>A younger group with more opportunities, better education, good superannuation, and usually working full time.</dd>
					<dt>Established Middle</dt><dd>Have enough savings to be relativelly stable month-to-month.</dd>
					<dt>Emerging Affluent</dt><dd>The youngest overall group, with big dreams and high wages - But usually with less savings and more spending than the established middle.</dd>
					<dt>Established Affluent</dt><dd>Will always have enough wealth to live comfortably</dd>
