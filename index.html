			<p>But don’t be fooled. The divisions of class are hidden, yet if you look hard enough you will find very tangible class structures. And these structures confine us in all sorts of ways, in all aspects of our lives.</p>

				Class seems pretty straightforward. But, there's a lot going on under the surface that affects us directly. It might make you think very differently from your initial answer.
			</p>
			<p>For instance, the kind of job you have is probably the first thing you thought of.</p>
			<p>And yes, it has a massive effect on your financial status. But it’s more than jobs that pay a little, and jobs that pay a lot.</p>
			<p>It’s also about how much your job guarantees you’ll earn enough to make a living.</p>

				<p>In the case of part time jobs, contract work, and self-employment, the amount of work you can complete varies wildly. And putting extra effort into getting enough hours of work in each week means extra stress.</p>
				<p>This is called 'underemployment', it's a big issue that isn't talked about. The number of people who are underemployed is almost as large as those who are unemployed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Class isn't just a job-by-job thing either. Those of parents with high-prestige jobs will usually earn more, even for the exact same job.
				</p>
				<p>
					And technical knowledge, how suited your role is to management tasks, the transferability of your skills, and how easily your job can be automated all impact your prospects of securing a living wage.

				<p>So class is more than job distinctions or salary. But this is <strong>just the tip of the iceberg.</strong></p>
		<p>Naturally, wealth determines what housing you can buy, and in turn where
			you can live. But, <strong>wealth is becoming more and more geographically
			isolated.</strong></p>
		<p>We can measure this by the number of suburbs where the average person is
			in the bottom 10% in terms of wealth. The closer to the edges of
			disadvantage a suburb is, the more people fall under this threshold. In
			the 5 years <strong>from 2006 to 2011</strong>, the number of deeply poor suburbs <strong>rose by
		42%</strong>.</p>
		<p>This geographic divide has the most visible effect on your daily life.</p>
